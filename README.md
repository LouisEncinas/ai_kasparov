# DumpAI

## Prologue

The idea behind this project was to create a Chess AI. However, I have never done such a thing before, and creating it from scratch will be very hard. That is why I decided to implement simpler stuff first. This project gathers all the subprojects I work on my free time that are related to Artificial Intelligence. <br>

## Chess - Initial Project

The idea is simple : create an AI that plays chess. 

## Pogostuck

I wanted to try to create an AI that plays a game. One game I played a lot is Pogostuck, so the goal of this subproject is to create a version of Pogostuck in Python (simple), then to implement an AI which plays the game.
